## 8085 Microprocessor

8085 is pronounced as "eighty-eighty-five" microprocessor. It is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Intel in 1977 using NMOS technology.

It has the following configuration âˆ’

1.8-bit data bus

2.16-bit address bus, which can address upto 64KB

3.A 16-bit program counter

4.A 16-bit stack pointer

5.Six 8-bit registers arranged in pairs: BC, DE, HL

6.Requires +5V supply to operate at 3.2 MHZ single phase clock

## Feature of this simulator

1 .This simulator allows user to see the whole program with the memory address.

2 .You can debug you program step by step you will see whole memory,flag,registers.

3 .You can implement the following command in the simulator
   
    
    Load and store: MOV, MVI,LXI,LDA,STA,LHLD,SHLD,STAX,XCHG.
    Arithmetic: ADD,ADI,SUB,INR,DCR,INX,DCX,DAD,SUI.
    Logical: CMA,CMP.
    Branching: JMP,JC,JNC,JZ,JNZ.
    
## Technology Used

This Project is made up in two language.All the commands and main are written in c++ and all header file are written c.

## How to use

1 .Download the zip file of this repo(https://github.com/the-vansh/8085).

2 .Unzip it in any folder and open that folder in vs-code or any other Ide that supports c and c++.

3 .Open "input.text" and write your program in 8085 commands and save it.

4 .Open "main.cpp" and directly hit the run button to it.

5 .In terminal 
    
    a.Write the staring address
    b.Set the memory if needed
    c.Choose the option according to your need in main menu.
